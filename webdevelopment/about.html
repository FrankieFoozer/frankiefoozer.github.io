        <h3>about / credentials</h3>

        <p>
        Hi there! My name is Frank Corridori. I’m a full-time professor here at the University of Missouri working in the Strategic Communication department of the J-School. My background is in graphic design, and art direction for advertising. I also work with students as the Creative Director of MOJO Ad®, the student-staffed advertising agency on campus. When I first started my career as a designer, I did some HTML coding and web design / development, and a fair amount of Flash website development, and actionscripting (RIP Flash).  
        
        <br>I’m mostly looking to refamiliarize myself with web design / coding and modern best practices. I’m incredibly rusty with HTML, as I haven’t had to use that muscle in a long time, and thought it would be worthwhile revisiting and redeveloping some old skillsets. Some of my first projects will likely be marketing materials that I use for myself, and my interests. In the little free time that I have, I enjoy cycling, playing guitar, cooking, photography, and painting. I also really like cars and motorcycles, and enjoy taking mine out for leisurely drives with no particular destination in mind.

        <p>
                        In his career, Frank Corridori has been an art director, creative director,
            creative and design consultant, photographer, illustrator, writer and interactive
            designer. He has practiced design and art direction in markets including New
            York City, Phoenix, and Columbia, Missouri.
            Over the course of his 14 years working as a creative, Corridori has worked on
            a wide range of clients and projects, including marketing and advertising
            campaigns from high-end New York retailers, package design and branding for
            food and beverage startups, interactive design for visual artists to government
            agencies, integrated campaigns and branding for products including fitness
            equipment, high-end arcades, and educational institutions. Working on such a
            diverse set of clients has ensured a portfolio that mirrors his eclectic resume,
            and breadth of experience. Corridori’s work is a reflection of his belief that the
            discipline of art direction and design lay at the intersection of art and
            commerce, and are always best executed when grounded in strategy.
            Corridori teaches courses in strategic design, and visual communication as it
            relates to advertising. In addition to teaching, he has continued his
            professional career with national clients seeking a creative gun-for-hire, and a
            desire to influence, enlighten, entertain and alter perception.
